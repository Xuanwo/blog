I was trying to use this package in go... might need help. how do you query module {} block read it using hcl and make changes and write it back? I understood the part where you initialize the Config for string, bool etc. Not sure how to use the hclwrite methods to do it. I did manage to read the file contents to a byte array like you mentioned.. Any help will be appreciated.","created_at":"2020-04-26T02:13:45Z"}]
