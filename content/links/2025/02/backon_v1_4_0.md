I am happy to announce the release of [BackON v1.4.0](https://github.com/Xuanwo/backon/releases/tag/v1.4.0) [via archive.is](https://archive.is/U9DXda).

BackON is a rust library for making retry like a built-in feature provided by Rust.

```rust
use backon::ExponentialBuilder;
use backon::Retryable;

async fn fetch() -> Result<String> {
    Ok("hello, world!".to_string())
}

let content = fetch.retry(ExponentialBuilder::default()).await?;
```

The biggest change in this release was introduced by [@wackazong](https://github.com/wackazong), who correctly added `std` support for `no-std` without requiring a global random seed. With this improvement, users on `no-std` can now use `rand` properly as well.

[@NumberFour8](https://github.com/NumberFour8) brought us `futures-timer` support, allowing `backon` to be used in an async context without relying on Tokio. [@Matt3o12](https://github.com/Matt3o12) contributed by making some functions `const`, enabling many backoff builder APIs to be used in a `const` context.

Thank you all!
