I just published the announcement for [New OpenDAL Committer: xxchan](https://github.com/apache/opendal/discussions/5657).

I knew [xxchan](https://github.com/xxchan) even before OpenDAL. We used to work together at [BeyondStorage](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage), a discontinued project similar to today's OpenDAL but written in Golang.

It's quite nice to see xxchan showing up again in the OpenDAL community. After leaving the same company, I haven't talked with him for a while, and I never invited him to actively contribute to OpenDAL. He just appears from time to time and fixes issues randomly. He has been contributing to OpenDAL since February 11, 2023, at his own pace, based on his needs.

That's really a great thing for me. An open-source community needs passionate contributors to drive projects forward by adding major features and improvements. However, it also needs contributors like xxchan, who fix issues, clean up messy code, and contribute at their own pace.

Wish him have fun and enjoy his contributions to OpenDAL!
