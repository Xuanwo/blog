I'm currently trying to **learn**, **work**, and **think** in an open-source manner.

**Learning openly**

-    Have public discussions with my friends on [discussions](https://github.com/Xuanwo/Xuanwo/discussions)
-    Document and organize what I've learned at [Xuanwo's Note](https://note.xuanwo.io)

**Working publicly and reporting to the community**

-    I earn my income by working on open-source projects (currently employed by [@datafuselabs](https://github.com/datafuselabs))
-    I track all my work at [Xuanwo's Work](https://work.xuanwo.io)
-    A community-facing [weekly report](/reports) 

**Sharing well-formed thoughts via blogging**

-    Content I find meaningful will be published on [Xuanwo's Blog](https://xuanwo.io)

**Let's rock!**
